## ‚ú® Features

* **Jetpack Compose**: Built entirely with Jetpack Compose, Android's modern toolkit for building
  native UI.
* **Material 3 Expressive**: Implements the latest Material 3 expressive components and theming.
* **Interactive Examples**: Provides interactive examples of various components, allowing users to
  see them in action.
* **Modular Code**: Organized by component for easy understanding and reusability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Key Libraries

This project is built using a modern Android development stack, leveraging the power of Kotlin and
Jetpack Compose:

* **UI Toolkit**:
    * [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose): Android's modern declarative
      UI toolkit.
    * [Material 3 Expressive Components](https://m3.material.io/blog/building-with-m3-expressive):
      Implementing the latest Material Design guidelines using expressive components.
    * [Material Icons Extended](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/icons/Icons.Filled):
      Providing a rich set of icons.
* **Architecture & Navigation**:
    * [Android Jetpack Libraries](https://developer.android.com/jetpack): Suite of libraries to help
      follow best practices (e.g., ViewModel, Lifecycle).
    * [Hilt for Dependency Injection](https://dagger.dev/hilt/): For managing dependencies in a
      robust and scalable way.
    * [Jetpack Navigation 3](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-3): For
      navigating between composable screens.
* **Data Handling**:
    * [Kotlinx Serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization): For serializing and
      deserializing Kotlin objects to/from JSON.
* **Build & Development Tools**:
    * [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio): The official IDE for Android
      development.
    * [Gradle](https://gradle.org/): For build automation.
    * [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless): For code formatting, configured
      with [KtLint](https://ktlint.github.io/) (including `io.nlopez.compose.rules:ktlint` for
      Compose-specific rules).

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

- [X] Expand component coverage: Integrate all Material 3 expressive components with comprehensive
  descriptions and usage guidelines
- [ ] Code navigation: Implement direct links from component examples to their corresponding source
  code for easier exploration.
- [ ] Overall polish: Conduct a thorough review and refinement of the entire application for
  improved user experience, performance, and code quality.
